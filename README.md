# CFS130 Foundations of the Internet

### About

This course was among the first programming courses I took. Here I was introduced to web development concepts and principles. Foundation topics include protocols, Linux commands, file management, remote access, and file transfer. Additionally, I learned current industry-standard html/xhtml, cascading style sheets, image editing for web optimization, and the use of various editors. 

The website I created can be found [here!](https://cs.sunyocc.edu/~e.e.marticello/cis130project/index.html)

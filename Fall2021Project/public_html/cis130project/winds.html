                <h3>Brass vs Woodwind</h3>
                <p>Wind instruments are typically grouped into two families. 
                <p>Brass instruments and Woodwind instruments. Instruments are categorized 
                    by way of utilizing the instrument.</p> 
                <p>For example, a saxophone may often be made of brass, but it is 
                    classified as a Woodwind because it produces sound from a 
                    vibrating reed. </p>

                <p><img src="images/saxophoneMulti.png" alt="Winds Instrument Example- Saxophone">As the name suggests, 
                    wind instruments use air as a medium to produce sounds of different pitches.</p>
                <p>Wind instruments will have a mouthpiece to work on the principles of sound waves, resonance, and harmonics.</p>
                <p>Acoustics can be set and altered by changing how one blows into the instrument.</p>

                <h3>What are "Reeds"?</h3>
                <p>Reeds, typically made from cane, have a rough rectangular shape that tapers towards the tip. In single reed 
                    instruments the back of this piece sits against the mouthpiece and vibrates to create sound. </p>
                <p>With double reed instruments the two reeds vibrate against each other instead. </p>

            <aside>
                <h3>Fun Fact- Bagpipes!</h3>
                <p>Bagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reeds.</p> 
                <p>However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double 
                    reed instrument since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips. Fun!</p>

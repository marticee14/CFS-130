                <h3>Plucking, Bowing, and Striking</h3>
                <p>Plucking, Bowing, and Striking are methods to sound a string.</p>
                <p>One would pluck the strings of a guitar, harp, or ukulele using a finger, thumb, or pick.
                Although, instruments normally played by bowing may also be plucked.</p>
                <p>A bow is a stick with a strip of horse tail hairs stretched between its ends. The bow is moved across 
                the strings to emit sound.</p>
                <p>The piano uses the striking method. The felt hammers inside the piano, once hit, strike the strings on the inside.</p>

                    Stringed Instruments sound when the strings are plucked, strummed, hit, or rubbed.</p>
                <p>Many stringed instruments have a <em>body</em> that helps resonance and increases audibility.</p>
                <p>Unlike the woodwind instruments, string instruments can be grouped by construction or how they’re played. 
                    We’ll focus on construction of the instrument. </p>

                <h3>Categorizing String Instruments- Based on Construction</h3>
                <p>Stringed instruments can be grouped into three major categories when considering construction.</p>
                <p><b>Lutes</b> - Instruments that support strings by with a neck and body. Popular examples are a guitar and violin.</p>
                <p><b>Harps</b> - Instruments that contain the strings in a frame.</p>
                <p><b>Zithers</b> - Instruments that mount the strings on a body, frame or tube. Picture a Harpsichord or Cimbalom. (The piano would be categorized here as well.)</p>

                <h3>Fun Fact- "Violin" Origins!</h3>
                <p>The word "violin" comes from the Latin word <em>vitula</em>, which also means "female cow."</p>
